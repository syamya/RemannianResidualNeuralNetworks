                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Dental cavity identification using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques,
                    especially through X-rays, plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
                    Traditional detection systems often suffer from high error rates and low accuracy. To address these
                    challenges, a sophisticated model based on Riemannian Residual Neural Networks with Improved Sooty
                    Tern Optimization (RR2Net-ImSTOpt) is proposed. The model uses the DENTEX dataset for analysis,
                    incorporating noise reduction and image enhancement using Guided Box Filtering (GBF). Feature
                    extraction is performed using the Inception Vis-Transformer, followed by optimization of RR2Net's
                    weight parameters via the Improved Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm. This approach achieves
                    impressive results with a recall of 99.8% and an accuracy rate of 99.9%, surpassing current methods
                    in accuracy and reducing false positives. RR2Net-ImSTOpt’s capability to handle large medical
                    datasets makes it an ideal solution for clinical dental cavity detection, enhancing diagnostic
                    efficiency and precision.</p>

                <h3>Model Used</h3>
                <p>This manuscript proposes an advanced framework for dental cavity identification using Riemannian
                    Residual Neural Networks (RR2Net) enhanced with an Improved Sooty Tern Optimization
                    Algorithm(ImSTOA). The framework utilizes Guided Box Filtering (GBF) to enhance image clarity and
                    reduce noise in DENTEX dental images. Feature extraction is performed using Inception
                    Vis-Transformer, capturing relevant patterns while reducing computational complexity. RR2Net-based
                    classification efficiently learns complex patterns in data, while ImSTOA optimizes RR2Net’s weight
                    parameters, improving accuracy, reducing computational time, and minimizing error rates. This
                    approach significantly advances the accuracy and efficiency of dental cavity detection, offering a
                    promising solution for clinical use.</p>

                <h3>Accuracy</h3>
                <p>The RR2Net-ImSTOpt model for dental cavity detection significantly outperforms cur- rent methods,
                    achieving 99.9% accuracy and 99.8% recall. By incorporating Guided Box Filtering for noise reduction
                    and Inception Vis-Transformer for efficient feature extraction, it ensures high-quality input for
                    classification. The Improved Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm optimizes RR2Net’s weight parameters,
                    boosting accuracy and reducing false-positive rates. The model's ability to handle large datasets
                    makes it ideal for clinical use, enhancing diagnosis and treatment planning. Future work may focus
                    on improving generalization, real-time detection, and integrating transfer learning for better
                    performance in clinical applications.</p>
